Review
1) An indexed array has numbers as keys, and an associative array has strings as keys
2) Use quotation marks for an array's key only if you are using an associative array. Quotes shouldn't be used for keys if your keys are numbers,
variables, or constants
3) Print a specific array element by using the array's name and the index, like $arrayname['index']. 
To print the whole array, you can use print_r() or var_dump() and the name of the array
4) If you forget the square brackets when assigning a value to an array item, it replaces the entire array and leaves you with a scalar variable
5) The 'count()' or 'sizeof()' function returns the number of elements in an array
6) When printing an element from an array inside a 'print' function, you surround the array in curly braces to prevent problems with single quotes
or double quotes in the array key value. Curly braces are also used to print array values when the keys are strings.
7) The asort() function sorts an array values and maintains the index/key information, while sort simply sorts the values regardless of keys. The only difference
between sort() and rsort() is that rsort() sorts an array in reverse.
8) The explode() function syntax is explode(delimiter, string, [optional limit]).
