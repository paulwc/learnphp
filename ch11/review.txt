1)  PHP version 5.3.13
2) To make a file or directory writeable to your server, the file/directory must have the correct user permissions
   to permit writing and be accessible to the web server. The user account that executes php and apache (sometimes www-data, apache, etc)
   must either be the owner of the file, in a group that owns the file or be given write access under the 'other' group.
3) The web root directory is the base directory on a server that is accessible via HTTP. This directory is the base access point
   for HTTP requests and allows access to all subfolders/files within it. Files placed in directories above the web root are not
   accessible via regular HTTP requests. The web root directory for my computer is inside my local installation of WAMP server, which
   I installed to a secondary hard drive, eg) 'D:\wamp\www\'
4) Two ways to write data to a file are with the function file_put_contents($file, $data) or if you are using an older version of PHP, 
   then you can use a file pointer to open the file (fopen()), write data to it (fwrite()), and then close the file (fclose()).
5) To append new data to existing files, you can use the FILE_APPEND optional argument with the file_put_contents() function, or you can
   open the file using the fopen() function with the 'a' or 'a+' mode selected.
6) To ensure new data is written on it's own line, you take care to use the appropriate line break at the end of all data you write. This
   is normally '\n' or '\r\n', but you can use the special PHP constant PHP_EOL to automatically use the correct characters.
7) For a form to accept file uploads, it must have the enctype="multipart/form-data" argument added to the form tag to let browsers know
   it contains different types of form data, must use the method='post' argument, and must have an <input type='file' ...> tag.
8) A PHP script uses the $_FILES[] array to access uploaded files. The move_uploaded_file() function is used to move the uploaded file
   from its temporary place on the server to a destination the user decides.
9) The file() and file_get_contents() functions read an entire file into memory. The fgetcsv() function reads a user defined amount of data
   from a file broken up by a separator as an array.
