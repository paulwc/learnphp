1) The basic syntax of a user defined function is "function userFunctionName(parameter1, parameter2) { statements }"
2) Your own functions follow the same naming rules as PHP variables, except the do not include a $ at the beginning.
   Functions cannot have spaces in their names, and their names should be meaningful.
3) Function arguments must follow the naming restrictions as any other PHP variable.
4) To provide a default value to a functions expression, you define it in the function definition as assigned
   to a particular value. Ex) function myCustomFunction($param1, $param2='hi') { statement(s) } 
5) If the backslash didn't preceed the $ in this expression, the variable's value would be printed out twice.
   The backslash exists to escape the $ character so that it will actually print the $ character.
6) Variable scope refers to the realm in which a variable exists (in the code).
   A function argument has limited variable scope, and only exists in the realm of the function it is defined in.
   Each function has its own separate, local scope.
7) Since an included file is treated as if it were actually part of the original file's code, a variable defined
   in an included file has the same scope as any other variable defined in the file that included it (unless the variable
   is defined inside a function in the included file, then the variable is limited to that function as expected.
