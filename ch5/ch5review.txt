Review:
Strings are created like any other php variable surrounded by either double
or single quotes. 
$a_string = 'Hello world';

Single quotation marks do not evaluate php variables
contained within them, double quotes do.

The concatenation operator is the . operator
The concatenation assignment operator is .=

A newline in a string printed to the browser only
affects the html source of the page and does not affect the 
visual display of the page. The nl2br library function 
will convert a newline to a break tag and create the vertical space
you expect to see with a newline.

Problems such as malicious XSS attacks and user created
formatting and css on your page. To prevent this,
php library functions such as htmlentities,
htmlspecialchars and strip_tags exist

The library function urlencode makes data safe to pass
to a URL

To escape problematic chars within a string, you can 
use flavours of str_replace, or htmlspecialchars and
htmlentities. You can also use regular expressions.

Chars in a string are indexed beginning at 0.

The trim function removes whitespace at the beginning
and end of a string.
